    <header id="while-statement"><h1>WHILE Statement</h1></header>
    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
      With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:<p>
<pre>
<code>
      var n = 0;
      var x = 0;
      while (n < 3) {
        n++;
        x += n;
      }
</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li> After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>

    <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section">
    <header id="for-statement"><h1>FOR Statement</h1></header>
    <p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. When a for loop executes, the following occurs:
<pre><code>
  for([initialExpression];
  [condition];
  [incrementExpression])
  statement</code></pre>
<p>The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.
The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
Control returns to step 2</p>
 <h3>Eample</h3>
    <p>The following function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list . The for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to zero. It checks that i is less than the number of options in the  element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by one after each pass through the loop.</p>
    <pre><code>
function howMany(selectObject) {
var numberSelected = 0;
for(var i = 0; i < selectObject
.options.length;i++)
{
if (selectObject.options[i].selected){
  numberSelected++;
    }
  }
  return numberSelected;
}
var btn = document.getElementById('btn');
btn.addEventListener('click', function()
{
alert
('Number of options selected:'+howMany
(document.selectForm.musicTypes));
});
</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section">
    <header id="function"><h1>Function</h1></header>
    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword,  followed by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the Function</li>
      <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
      <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
<pre><code>
function square(number) {
return number * number;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.

If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
<h3>Eample</h3>
<pre><code>function myFunc(theObject){
  theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}
var mycar =
{make:'Honda',model:'Accord',year: 1998};
var x, y;

x = mycar.make;
// x gets the value "Honda"

myFunc(mycar);
y = mycar.make;
 // y gets the value "Toyota"
 //(the make property was
 changed by the function)
</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section">
    <header id="objects"><h1>Objects and properties</h1></header>
    <p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:</p>
    <pre><code>objectName.propertyName</code></pre>
    <p>Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let's create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:</p>
    <h3>Eample</h3>
    <pre><code>
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;
</code></pre>
<p>Unassigned properties of an object are undefined</p>
<pre><code>
myCar.color; // undefined
</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section">
<header id="promise"><h1>Promise </h1></header>
<p>A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Since most people are consumers of already-created promises, this guide will explain consumption of returned promises before explaining how to create them.</p>
<p>Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions, one called if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.

Here's some code that uses createAudioFileAsync():</p>
<h3>Eample</h3>
<pre><code>
function successCallback(result) {
console.log
("Audio file ready at URL:"+result);
}
function failureCallback(error) {
console.log
("Error generating audio file:"+error);
}
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings,
successCallback,failureCallback);
</pre></code>
<p>â€¦modern functions return a promise you can attach your callbacks to instead:

If createAudioFileAsync() were rewritten to return a promise, using it could be as simple as this:</p>
<pre><code>
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings)
.then(successCallback, failureCallback);</code></pre>
<p>That's shorthand for:</p><br>
<pre><code>
const promise=
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings);
promise.then
(successCallback, failureCallback);</code></pre>
<p>We call this an <em>asynchronous function call</em>.</p>
